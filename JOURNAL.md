Power Connections
1) Battery to 7805 Regulator
2) Input of 7805: Connected to the positive of 9V battery.
3) Output of 7805: Provides a stable 5V to ESP32-CAM.
This ensures the ESP32-CAM gets a regulated voltage suitable for stable operation.
ESP32-CAM Power
4) 5V pin of ESP32-CAM: Connected to the output of the 7805 regulator.
5) GND pin of ESP32-CAM: Connected to the common ground from batteries.

## System Architecture
1. **ESP32-CAM** captures the image  
2. The image is encoded and sent to **Imagga API** for content analysis  
3. The Imagga API responds with detected tags (objects, scenes, etc.)  
4. The system forwards the image and detected information to the **Telegram bot**  
5. Telegram bot sends a notification message and image to the configured chat or group
